# life_expectancy_analysis
An in-depth statistical analysis examining the relationship between GDP per capita, OECD membership, and life expectancy across countries. This project employs multiple linear regression and data visualization techniques to uncover complex socioeconomic health determinants.

Multiple Linear Regression Analysis on Life Expectancy

Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive statistical analysis that explores how a country's economic status and international affiliations impact the life expectancy of its population. Using GDP per capita as a measure of economic prosperity and OECD membership as a marker for international economic integration, the project employs advanced regression techniques to delve into the intricacies of public health determinants.

Technical Skills Showcased

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The project begins with meticulous data cleaning and preparation, ensuring accurate analysis by removing irrelevant columns and handling missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Employing both statistical summaries and visual explorations, the project offers a deep dive into the data's underlying structure and distributions.
Statistical Modeling: At the core of the project is the use of multiple linear regression models, including models with interaction terms, to capture the nuanced impact of GDP and OECD membership on life expectancy.
Model Comparison: The analysis includes the use of ANOVA to compare models, highlighting the statistical significance of additional variables and interactions.
Data Visualization: Through various plots such as scatter plots, box plots, and line plots, the project visualizes complex relationships in the data, making the findings accessible and understandable.
Interpretation and Communication: The project goes beyond number-crunching to offer clear, jargon-free interpretations of the results, reflecting an understanding that the true value of data analysis lies in actionable insights.
Programming and Tool Proficiency: The entire analysis is carried out using Python, showcasing proficiency with libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Statsmodels for statistical modeling.
